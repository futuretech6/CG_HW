With glasses:
$$
\begin{cases}
    \text{Red}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x
        = \int_{500}^{550} 1\times1\text{d}x
        +\int_{550}^{600} 3\times3\text{d}x
        +\int_{600}^{650} 2\times1\text{d}x
        = 600
    \\
    \text{Green}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x
        = \int_{500}^{550} 1\times1\text{d}x
        +\int_{550}^{600} 3\times3\text{d}x
        +\int_{600}^{650} 2\times1\text{d}x
        = 600
    \\
    \text{Blue}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Without glasses:
$$
\begin{cases}
    \text{Red}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x
        = \int_{500}^{550} 1\times0\text{d}x
        +\int_{550}^{600} 3\times0\text{d}x
        +\int_{600}^{650} 2\times4\text{d}x
        = 400
    \\
    \text{Green}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x
        = \int_{500}^{550} 1\times1\text{d}x
        +\int_{550}^{600} 3\times3\text{d}x
        +\int_{600}^{650} 2\times0\text{d}x
        = 500
    \\
    \text{Blue}: & \int f(x)s(x)\text{d}x = 0
\end{cases}
$$

Since the principle of these glasses is to **fliter** the part of the spectrum where differernt base colors(like green and red) overlap, the normal color will suffer a loss of the light with certain wavelength(that has been filtered) and thus causes a **shift of their spectra**. This will lead to a distortion of color, which means the color we see through the glasses will be different from things we see without them.
